**ðŸ©º Skin Disease Classification with ResNet50 & FastAPI**

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**


This project is a Deep Learning-based Skin Disease Classification System that uses a ResNet50 model trained on dermatology images.
It can classify an uploaded skin image into one of 6 disease categories with high accuracy.

The trained model is deployed using FastAPI, providing an easy-to-use REST API for predictions.

**ðŸ§ª Classes Covered**


The model can classify skin images into the following categories:

. Acne and Rosacea Photos

. Atopic Dermatitis Photos

. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)

. Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL)

. Melanocytic Nevi (NV)

. Nail Fungus and other Nail Disease

**ðŸš€ Tech Stack**


. Python 3.10+

. TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning Model)

. ResNet50 (Pre-trained CNN model)

. FastAPI (Backend deployment)

. Uvicorn (ASGI server)

. PIL & NumPy (Image preprocessing)
