# 🩺 Skin Disease Classification with ResNet50 & FastAPI

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Deep Learning-based Skin Disease Classification System** that leverages a **ResNet50 model** trained on dermatology images.  
It can classify an uploaded skin image into **one of 6 disease categories** with high accuracy.  

The trained model is deployed using **FastAPI**, providing an easy-to-use **REST API** for predictions.

## 🧪 Classes Covered
The model can classify skin images into the following categories:

- 🧴 **Acne and Rosacea Photos**  
- 🌿 **Atopic Dermatitis Photos**  
- 🧬 **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**  
- 🟤 **Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL)**  
- 🌑 **Melanocytic Nevi (NV)**  
- 💅 **Nail Fungus and Other Nail Diseases**
